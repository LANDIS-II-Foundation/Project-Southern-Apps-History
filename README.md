# Project-Southern-Apps-History

Across many landscapes, the processes that generated contemporary vegetation patterns are poorly understood due to insufficient historical data.  The southern Appalachians in the southeastern United States exemplify this conundrum:  Although the canopy is currently dominated by oaks, oak regeneration is limited.  A clear understanding of the processes that generated the current oak canopy â€“ and that limit oak regeneration today - is necessary for making decision about how to manage oaks into the future.  We used a landscape simulation approach to generate a historic analog of the landscape beginning in 1500 CE and simulated forward to 2000 CE, and included estimates of critical processes and events:  Native American burning up to ~1700; colonial settlement and burning from 1700-1900; the loss of chestnut (Castanea dentata), a keystone species, due to blight around 1940; and fire exclusion beginning in 1920.  Our simulations suggest that although fire is necessary to maintain regeneration across the landscape, it was the sudden loss of chestnut that created a unique opportunity for oak dominance across the landscape.  The extent of oak dominance today is likely a millennial maximum for the species.  Future oak dominance at the current extent would require more fire than would be acceptable given human settlement patterns although local efforts at reintroducing prescribed fire can maintain this critical species.
